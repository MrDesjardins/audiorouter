# M03 virtual-routing contract evidence

## 2026-09-06 — capability-contract foundation

The authoritative Rust and shared TypeScript node registries now include
`virtual-render-source@1` and `virtual-capture-sink@1`. Both advertise an
explicit unavailable capability reason: `requires M03 managed virtual driver`.
The UI library exposes both entries for discovery but keeps them disabled, so
the editor cannot imply that a virtual endpoint exists or install a driver.

The portable engine matches both kinds as device-bound placeholders. Disabled
nodes therefore retain the existing silence-boundary behavior; enabled nodes
do not create a fake bus or bypass resource validation. M03 driver installation,
bridge ownership, endpoint identity, and Windows routing remain open.

Validation: all locked Rust workspace tests and strict Clippy passed; the
contracts TypeScript check passed; UI Vitest passed 56 tests using Vite's
runner config loader. The UI production build could transform and render but
Windows returned `EPERM` while creating the configured or alternate output
directory, so no production-build pass is claimed. No driver, audio endpoint,
or machine audio configuration was changed.

The control-plane foundation now includes `VirtualBusLease`. A lease accepts
one non-empty owner, rejects competing acquisition, requires both owner and
generation for release, and prevents delayed releases from clearing a newer
owner. `force_release` clears ownership for crash/reconnect cleanup while the
generation remains monotonic. Two domain regressions cover ownership and stale
release behavior. This primitive carries no audio and is not a driver or
endpoint implementation.

`VirtualBusRegistry` now provides the portable desired-state inventory for up
to eight stereo buses. It trims and bounds names, rejects duplicate IDs and
case-insensitive names, sorts listing by stable ID, requires disablement before
delete, and refuses deletion while a lease is held. Lease acquisition/release
is routed through the same registry. Two additional regressions cover naming,
capacity, disable/delete ordering, and lease cleanup. Native driver endpoint
creation, persistence, bridge ownership, and external-client routing remain
open.

The shared control API now exposes `virtualDevices.list` as a read-only,
cursor-compatible inventory query. It reports each managed bus's desired state,
availability reason, endpoint identity placeholders, and current lease owner;
the empty initial registry is returned without activating a stream or creating
an endpoint. The method is included in domain discovery and the generated
TypeScript client contract.

CLI and MCP adapter parity now expose the same read-only query as
`virtual-devices list` and `list_virtual_devices`, respectively. The CLI
regression confirms an empty initial managed inventory rather than inventing
third-party cable endpoints. Lifecycle mutation, persistence, and native driver
integration remain open.
